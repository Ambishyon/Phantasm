Before anything else, you should learn about how interfaces are structured.

A standard interface may look like this:
```lua
{
	Theme = "MyThemeName";

	Enabled = true;

	Bindings = {};
	Functions = {};
	Components = {};
	Elements = {};
	Animations = {};
}
```

In this example interface, `Theme` represents either the name of the theme you wish your interface's elements to pull their default properties from, or directly providing the theme right there.

`Enabled` is simply a property to set on the `ScreenGui` object that is generated by default if you do not provide a parent container for the interface to use.

`Bindings` holds all the bindings that are bundled within that specific interface and are not provided from either the engine itself or the public Bindings folder located in `ReplicatedStorage.Phantasm`

For the rest of the table properties, it is the same as `Bindings` with the exception of `Elements`, which is a mandatory key in your interface as it determines what Elements and Components are within your interface.

Every key except for `Elements` is optional and will be filled in with a default by the engine if not provided.
